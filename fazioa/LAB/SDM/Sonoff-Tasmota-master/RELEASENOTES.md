## Migration Information
See [wiki migration path](https://github.com/arendst/Sonoff-Tasmota/wiki/Upgrade#migration-path) for instructions how to migrate to a major version. Pay attention to the following version breaks due to dynamic settings updates:

1. Migrate to **Sonoff-Tasmota 3.9.x**
2. Migrate to **Sonoff-Tasmota 4.x**
3. Migrate to **Sonoff-Tasmota 5.14**
4. Migrate to **Sonoff-Tasmota 6.x**

## Release notes
### Change in default initial configuration tool
Firmware binary **sonoff-classic.bin** supports **WifiManager, Wps and SmartConfig** for initial configuration. The default tool is **Wps**.

To save memory space all other binaries support **WifiManager only**.

See _changelog.ino how to enable them again.
- Define WIFI_CONFIG_TOOL now contains the default behaviour once a SSID has been configured.
- If no SSID is configured making a wifi connection impossible the new define WIFI_CONFIG_NO_SSID will be used.
- While define WIFI_CONFIG_NO_SSID is set to WIFI_WPSCONFIG in my_user_config.h the compiler will check for define USE_WPS and if not enabled WIFI_CONFIG_NO_SSID will default to WIFI_MANAGER using the webserver. If define USE_WEBSERVER is also not enabled WIFI_CONFIG_NO_SSID will default to WIFI_SMARTCONFIG. If define USE_SMARTCONFIG is also not enabled WIFI_CONFIG_NO_SSID will default to a new option WIFI_SERIAL allowing to enter wifi parameters to serial which is always possible.
